# Building an E-Commerce Clothing Classifier Model

Automate e-commerce processes with image classification to transform the retail industry with cutting-edge AI.

## Project Description

Transform the retail industry with cutting-edge AI: develop an innovative clothing classification system to create a smarter, more efficient shopping experience.

Leveraging machine learning, youâ€™ll make it easier to find the perfect outfit among a variety of choices, opening up new possibilities in the rapidly evolving digital fashion world.

Fashion Forward is a new AI-based e-commerce clothing retailer. They want to use image classification to automatically categorize new product listings, making it easier for customers to find what they're looking for. It will also assist in inventory management by quickly sorting items.

As a data scientist tasked with implementing a garment classifier, your primary objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately categorizing images of clothing items into distinct garment types such as shirts, trousers, shoes, etc.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow or pytorch, opencv-python

### Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess clothing images for training.
- **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- **Image Classification**: Classify images of clothing items into distinct garment types.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using standard metrics.
